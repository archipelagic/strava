# Analyzing Strava data with Python.

This repo is dedicated to analyzing activties with a tracking software such as Strava. Having downloaded the data once, here's what this repo allows you to do:

- Get a high-level overview of your activities. The notebook is called `all_activities`.
- Analyze `.gpx` files that contain all the information related to a particular activity, see `analyzing_one_activity`
- To be added: a third notebook that will combine the two for further insights

Helper functions are stored in two `.py` files; one for graphs, one to transform the data. 

All the data that is used or generated in the process will be located inside the `data` folder.
